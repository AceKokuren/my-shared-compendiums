Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>\n<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the cure wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn’t work on a creature that has the Construct type.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Note</strong></p>\n<p>The “Creating Your Character” section provides special character-creation rules for the race options in this article. The races that use these rules can coexist seamlessly with races that use other rules. For example, the race options in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> have built-in ability score increases, while the races in this article don’t. Race options from both sources can adventure together.</p>\n<p>If you’d like a race that doesn’t appear in this article, such as an elf or a dwarf, to have similar ability score flexibility, the book <em><a title=\"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe\">Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything</a></em> provides a rule, called Customizing Your Origin, that gives you that flexibility. That book also gives you the option of building your own race, rather than choosing an existing one. That option is called the Custom Lineage. No matter which option you choose for your character—a race in this article, a <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> race, a race modified by the Customizing Your Origin rule, or a Custom Lineage—you can adventure with characters who are built with a different option.</p>\n<p>This sidebar builds on the design note in our previous Unearthed Arcana, “Gothic Lineages.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Size</b></p>\n<p>You are Medium or Small.

In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\n<p>The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\n\n<p><b>Darkvision</b> @Compendium[my-shared-compendiums.racialtraits.OqgWFrjT9cml1Pnh]{Darkvision}</p>\n<p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Increase</b></p>\n<p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>\n\n<p><b>Languages</b></p>\n<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\n\n<p><b>Age</b></p>\n<p>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\n\n<p><b>Alignment</b></p>\n<p>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\n\n<p><b>Size</b></p>\n<p>Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds.

You follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.</p>\n<p>Your class’s “Quick Build” section offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You’re free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.</p>\n<p>If you are replacing your race with a lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with these.</p>\n\n<p><b>Languages</b></p>\n<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.

These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the cure wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn’t work on a creature of the Construct type.</p>\n\n<p><b>Creature Type</b> @Compendium[my-shared-compendiums.racialtraits.jQulYopDgPNoPldV]{Creature Type}</p>\n<p>You are a Humanoid.</p>\n\n<p><b>Size</b></p>\n<p>You are Medium or Small.
